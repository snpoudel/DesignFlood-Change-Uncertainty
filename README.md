# Uncertainties in Design Flood Change Prediction Under Climate Change

Welcome to the repository for **"Uncertainty in Estimating the Relative Change of Design Floods under Climate Change: a Stylized Experiment with Process-Based, Deep Learning, and Hybrid Models"**.

This study explores uncertainty in estimating changes in design floods using six hydrological models - including process-based, deep learning, and hybrid approaches - across 30 basins in Massachusetts, USA. We evaluate how model structure, input error, and climate scenarios affect relative change estimates to support reliable hydrological projections for long-term planning.

This is currently under review for publication, but the preprint is available on ESS Open Archive.
